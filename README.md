# Facial Expression Detection

This repository contains the implementation of a facial expression detection model using deep learning techniques with PyTorch. The model is designed to classify facial expressions into various emotion categories, such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

1. `git clone https://github.com/ShayanHodai/facial-expression-detection.git`
2. `cd facial-expression-detection`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Dataset Preparation
You will need a dataset of facial images labeled with emotion categories. You can use the FER2013 dataset as an example.

The dataset should be organized into separate folders for each emotion category, as follows:

data/
  train/
    anger/
    disgust/
    fear/
    happy/
    neutral/
    sad/
    surprise/
  test/
    anger/
    disgust/
    fear/
    happy/
    neutral/
    sad/
    surprise/

# Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of a series of convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, followed by an attention mechanism to capture global dependencies between features. The final output is a softmax activation function that returns the probability distribution over the emotion categories.
